# HCI-Caffein-Line

Caffein Line is a group project done by 3 members, Michael (me), Sofie, and Ina, as the final project for the Human and Computer Interaction Course. This is the front-end of the Caffein Line website, which shows information about the cafe, along with its desserts and beverages menu, a contact form, and a payment form.
